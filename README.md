# CIS306Final

This repo should be ready to clone and import into Eclipse...

If you choose to copy project to workspace, make sure when you commit and git push you are pushing the version from the workspace and not the original which may not reflect the edits. 

Also, as you'll learn from the tutorials be sure git pull everytime you begin to work to ensure you have the most up to date version of the project. 

Happy Coding!
